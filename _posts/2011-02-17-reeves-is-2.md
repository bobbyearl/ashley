I hope to post pictures from Reeves&#8217; birthday soon.  I sat down to write this hoping to add some, but Bobby is not here and I can not figure this out. I know pretty pitiful.  Anyways we had a small gathering for Reeves&#8217;s birthday and he had a lot of fun. Thank you to everyone who made his day so special.  Reeves right now you are so much fun!  You add new sentences and new words everyday.  We are able to have little conversations and I love being able to talk more and more with you.  You love playing with your choo choos.  I think you would play with them all day if you could.  You are the best big brother William could ask for.  I should of known you would be incredibly sweet with him.  You have always been such a sweet boy.  You like to sing songs with me in the car and we switch between the theme songs to Elmo&#8217;s World, Yo Gabba Gabba, The Wonder Pets and of course&#8230;Barney.  Your favorite sentence right now is to say &#8220;I like &#8230;&#8221; and you rotate between all the special people in your life.  You also like to hide and give big family hugs with you in the middle of your daddy and I.  We love you so much and can not believe that you are already 2!

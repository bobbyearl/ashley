I know it is no excuse.  I really want to keep on top of this blog, but things have been a little busy around here.

First and foremost we have welcomed our second baby boy!  William Bradley Earl.  He was born December 16, 2010 at 5:44 pm.  He weighed 8 lbs 8 oz and was 21.5&#8243; long!  He has been a wonderful baby so far.  We are so happy to have him in our family.

Secondly we had our Christmas!  It was so much fun this year with Reeves being older.  He was so much fun!  Of course we spoiled him more than we should, but we just couldn&#8217;t stop ourselves.

I promise I will post pictures later this week of William, Reeves and our Christmas. I got a fancy new camera for Christmas and have been taking so many pictures.  My New Year&#8217;s resolution is actually to start taking more pictures of our family.

Sorry again about how long it has been since my last post, I&#8217;m going to try to do better!

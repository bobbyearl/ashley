Lately we have been busy working on our summer bucket list and having lots of fun.  I was worried this summer we wouldn&#8217;t be able to do to much since both boys are at such different stages but it has not slowed us down in the least. I guess it helps having two such great kids!  <img src="http://bobbyearl.com/ashley/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  I always consider July 4th sort of the mid-point for summer so I thought I would do a little update on how it is going. If you check out the previous post you can see that we have started checking off a few items, but we need to get busy.  Now some pictures of the boys and some of the fun we have had so far.

Some backyard fun

Sorry about the picture overload. Maybe I will go less than a month next time between posts and will not have to cram so much in.

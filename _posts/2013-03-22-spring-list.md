It has been over a year, almost 2 since I have been on this.  Maybe I&#8217;ll update on all the fun stuff we have done. Maybe I won&#8217;t, it is a lot of stuff.  We are all doing great.  Reeves is 4, William is 2.  They are both sweet, stubborn, smart, and keep us laughing.  I did a bucket list a few summers ago on here and we had a lot of fun with it.  So I am going to do one for this spring as well.  Here is our Spring 2013 Bucket list:

  * <del>Dye Easter Eggs</del>
  * <del>Easter Egg Hunt</del>
  * Picnic
  * Fly Kites
  * Farmers Market
  * Outdoor concert
  * Plant Flowers
  * Pick Strawberries
  * Outdoor movie night
  * Feed Ducks
  * Go to a baseball game
  * <del>Bike Rides</del>

It is not a huge list, but we really have a lot of fun hanging out at home, just relaxing and playing  so I do not want to take away from this time as well.

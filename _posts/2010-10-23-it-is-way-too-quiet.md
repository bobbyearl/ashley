Bobby is in Greenville for the weekend, and Reeves stayed the night with my parents.  I have the whole house to myself and i think that it is way too quiet around here right now.  It was nice to sleep in.  Well I slept in untl 8:30 that was the latest I could do.  It is crazy how having a child chages everything.  A few years ago I would have thought 8:30 was way too early to be up on a Saturday and now it feels like I have slept half he morning away.  Last night me and a friend went to go see the Rocky Horror Picture show at the Charleston Ballet.  It was so nice to go out.  Bobby won the tickets through a costume contest with the Charleston City Paper.  I just read this post and it sounds like a lot of rambling.  Oh well i will just blame it on the pregnancy and me not being a pro yet at blogging:)  I hope to have the nursery finished within the next week.  I can&#8217;t wait to share pictures with everyone!  Have a great rest of the weekend.

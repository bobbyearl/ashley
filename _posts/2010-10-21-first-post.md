I have been wanting to start a blog for a while.  Reeves is growing up so fast and I want to document more of it as well as everything that is going on with our family.  For those of you who don&#8217;t know we are expecting our second child this December. We are so excited for our new addition but can&#8217;t believe that he will be here so soon.  Reeves is definitely keeping us busy right now but it is so much fun!  I know this first blog is short but I have so much stuff I want to write about but I don&#8217;t want to start rambling.  Let&#8217;s hope I keep up with this.

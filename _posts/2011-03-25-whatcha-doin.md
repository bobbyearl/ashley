Reeves said this to me for the first time today.  I was in the closet getting dressed and he walked in saying &#8220;Hey mommy, whatcha doin&#8217;?&#8221;  Its so funny the things he is saying these days.

Bobby and I just dropped the kids off and are heading to Greenville for the weekend.  We had plane tickets to go to DC this weekend but decided about a week ago we just didn&#8217;t want to go.  But we are taking advantage of the arranged childcare for the weekend and heading up to visit some friends.  We will hopefully take some pictures.  ALL of our pictures lately are just the boys.  Actually when looking around the house it seems all the pictures of Bobby and I are either from the wedding or before, pretty sad.

I am having a really hard time thinking about leaving the boys.  I know we left Reeves for a weekend when he was a baby but he was a little older, I know he was already sitting up.  We leave them with my parents for a night fairly often but we are still in town.  I already miss them.  I&#8217;m excited to get out of town but it feels really weird to me to be leaving them behind.  I asked Bobby a few times if we could just take them with us, but that would defeat the purpose of this trip.

Its almost time to hit the road.  If you are in Greenville hit us up!

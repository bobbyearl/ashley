William you are four months old!  I can&#8217;t believe it.  I am trying to hold onto this infancy so much more than I did with your brother but it is still going by way too fast.  You had your four month check up yesterday and your dad took you.  You weighed in at 16 lbs 2 oz, and 25.5 inches.  That puts you at the 75 percentile for both.  You were at the 90th for both at two months, but you gained weight and height so everything looks great.

You are quite the chatterbox.  Just tonight while I was cooking dinner I set you in the kitchen to hang out with me and you just talked the whole time.  I love it.  I know soon you will be saying real words and we will have so many conversations in that exact spot.   You also love to talk to your brother.  When I am driving you two in the car, you just love to talk to him.  He loves to talk back and always gives you the sweetest smile.

You get to start food soon.  I&#8217;m not ready, but you are.  I am thinking of starting this weekend. I think you will love it.  You have been grabbing toys and bringing them to your mouth.  You can also almost turn over.  You can roll from your back to your side.  You love to do it.  I can tell the way you stare at your brother that you can&#8217;t wait to be moving around with him.

Now finally&#8230;some pictures!

p.s.  Your hair naturally does the mohawk.

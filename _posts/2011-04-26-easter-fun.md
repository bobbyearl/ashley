We had a fun few days here in our household. To start off Friday Reeves and I dyed Easter eggs.  I was worried that it was going to turn into a huge mess, but Reeves did great.  There was one point where he stuck a dye tablet in his mouth before it had dissolved.  I got it out as fast as I could, but his mouth was a little discolored.

Saturday we had an Easter Egg hunt at our next door neighbor Mia&#8217;s house.  Reeves had so much fun. It is great that he is old enough now to participate in an egg hunt.  Here is Reeves on the hunt, the loot, and a few of sweet William too!

The rest of the day saturday we just hung out with the neighbors, which is always a great time.

&nbsp;

Sunday we made our way to Summerville in the morning to go to church with my family.  Reeves wore a tie for the first time.  How cute does he look?

After church and a few photo ops with my family we made our way over to Mt. Pleasant and had an lunch/dinner with Bobby&#8217;s boss/work family.  We had another Easter Egg hunt and lots of great food and conversation. By the time we got back home we were all four pretty exhausted.  Both boys went right to sleep and I don&#8217;t think Bobby and I were far behind.

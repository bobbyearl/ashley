Yesterday I was able to get out with two of my girlfriends and it was great!  We did dinner and a movie. We went to eat at Sesame and of course it was delicious and we saw country strong which was really good but also really sad.

When I got home both boys were already in the bed for the night.  Bobby did a great job of taking care of them for the night.  It was his first night alone with both of them but he handled it with no problems.  I love hanging out with my boys all day but it was nice to have a nice to have a little break.

Also William did a 5 hour stretch last night!  Woohoo!

I know some people will disagree with me, but I think babywise is the best!  Maybe I was just lucky with two boys who are great sleepers but the principles in this book really seem to work.

I am sitting here on a Friday night at 7:45 and both boys have been in bed for almost an hour now, and will be in bed until the morning.  Using this book I was able to get Reeves to sleep through the night by 5 weeks and William by 7.  How great it that!!??!!

I would recommend this book to anyone!

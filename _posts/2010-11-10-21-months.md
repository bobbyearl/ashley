   I can not believe that Reeves is already 21 months old!  This age he is at is so much fun.  His vocabulary has really taken off, and it is really neat to be able to have mini conversations with him.  He is still such a sweet little boy;  although sometimes he does not like to hear the word no.  I guess that is one of the trade-offs for him to be able to tell me what he wants.  He loves to color, read books, Elmo, and watching Blue&#8217;s clues.  He also loves playing with all his friends, I&#8217;m so happy that he is so social.  We have yet to give him a haircut, I think it is getting close to that time.  I know they are going to cut all his cute little blond curls off and I am having a hard time with letting them go.  It seems as soon as a baby gets their first haircut they seem so much older.  I know i have to get it done soon though, some of his hair is getting out of control.  Well happy 21 months Reeves!

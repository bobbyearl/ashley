I have no good reason as to why I have not written anything down lately.  I have had time. I don&#8217;t really have a following so maybe that is why.  I do love looking back and reading the very few posts I did manage to document so here goes another try.

We are a few days away from a big Disney trip!  We all could not be more excited.  Reeves has started Kindergarten and is doing so well.  He is also playing soccer this year as well as Karate.  He is having so much fun with all of it.   William is playing his first team sport, football! And while we haven&#8217;t been able to make a game yet due to rain and trips out of town he is really enjoying the practices and should play a game next Saturday.

Other than that we are just staying busy with work, family and friends.

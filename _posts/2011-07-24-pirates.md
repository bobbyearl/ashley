I love living in Charleston.  I get to do things like I did today.  Reeves and I(and my mom and nephews and niece) all went out on a [pirate sailing adventure][1].  We left out of Shem creek and sailed out to the Charleston Harbor.  The kids even got to follow clues to find a treasure.  Reeves was a little young to sit and listen to the pirate stories, but the ship was big enough that we could walk around.  He had a great time and told Bobby all about it when he got home.  I did promise Bobby that next weekend he could take Reeves out to do something fun and I would stay home with William.

Look who got to drive the boat:[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-188" title="DSC_0477" src="http://ashley.simplyearl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DSC_0477-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />][2]

Reeves and I on the boat.  Do you see my awesome beaded necklace? Reeves got to pick some treasure out of the treasure box and he picked this out for me.  He also picked out something for Daddy.

Reeves loved to walk all around the boat:

On our way back to Shem Creek we rode right by the spot where Bobby and I got married.  I of course had to take a picture.

It was another great Saturday in a great city!

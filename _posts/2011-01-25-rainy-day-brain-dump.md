It&#8217;s raining outside.  Both of my kids are still in their pajamas.  I know thats my fault because I am the one who dresses them.  For some reason getting them in clothes seemed like a waste of time today.

I wish West Ashley had a Starbucks with a drive-thru window.  Getting two kids out of the car just for a coffee is not worth it.

I think Reeves has played with his train table all day long.  I will post some pictures as soon as I figure out how to do that.  I know that sounds bad, but I think that is what happens when you have a husband who loves to do all the tech stuff around the house and knows how to do it.  I have almost no idea how to do any of it.

I know this post was completely random&#8230;.sorry!

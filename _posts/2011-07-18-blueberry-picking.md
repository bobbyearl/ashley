Saturday afternoon Reeves decided he was not interested in taking his nap.  I decided to take advantage of the fact that it was not too hot outside and Bobby was home to look after William to take Reeves out. We went out to [Ambrose Family Farm][1] and go to pick blueberries.  We are CSA members there and have yet to make it out the the farm. We had a blast.  It was really nice to get out and have some alone time with Reeves.  No one else was at the farm at the time we were there so we had the entire place to ourselves.  Here are a few pictures of the day.

  Sunday morning I found <a href="http://www.alexandracooks.com/2011/06/29/buttermilk-blueberry-breakfast-cake/">this recipe</a> using the blueberries for breakfast on <a href="http://www.pinterest.com">Pinterest</a>.  It was delicious.  Reeves was so proud of himself that we used his blueberries for breakfast.

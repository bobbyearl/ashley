William you are 6 months old&#8230;well really almost 7 now.  You have pretty much mastered sitting up now and really love playing with Reeves.  You can say mama now but thats it.  Reeves said dada first so I feel it is only fair I get your first word.  You are starting to try to move around and I don&#8217;t think it will be too long before you do. You can almost stand-up if you are leaning/holding on to something&#8230;with me right behind you of course.  Your favorite place to do this is the train table.  Luckily you have a really great big brother and he will give you a train to play with while you are there.  You love to smile and laugh and have the cutest dimple on your right cheek. I feel like you have always been a part of this family, I can&#8217;t believe it has only been six months. In bad news you were sick for the very first time today.  I am not sure if it is because you are teething or just sick.  It was nothing too bad, just a small fever and lots of cuddling.

Thanks to my mom, Bobby and I were able to have a night without children last night.  It was nice to get out of the house just the two of us, but it did feel a little weird not having a kid around.

We went downtown and met some friends for dinner/drinks.  I think we are both feeling the aftermath this morning.  Luckily my mom is taking the kids to church with her so we get a little more time to rest.  Thanks again mom!

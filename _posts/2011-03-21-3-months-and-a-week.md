William I can not believe that you are already three months old!  You are just the sweetest baby.   You still love to cuddle and have me hold you.  We decided to get a baby bjorn. We never had one with Reeves but I need to be a little more hands free with you.  Luckily you love it!  I love that I can carry you around even more.

You smile all the time now and babble a lot.  You laughed for the first time when your dad was giving you a bath a few weeks ago.  I missed it but I&#8217;m glad your dad got to hear it.  Luckily I got to hear it this past weekend and I know its just a matter of time before your laughing all the time. Your gaga came over to visit and started tickling you and you just started. I still remember the first time I hear your brother Reeves laugh.  We were playing with a caterpillar toy he had.  Sorry I know this is your post but I didn&#8217;t blog or record anything when your brother was young and I don&#8217;t want to forget a memory like that.

The first couple months of your life you really only wanted me, of course I loved that but it also made me feel guilty about leaving you.  I felt bad for whoever I left you with and for you.  Now that you are a little older you seem to tolerate other people a lot more.  You are also able to be awake for longer periods of time  and concentrate on objects rather than just want to eat when you are awake.  It makes it a lot easier to step away for a little bit now and then.

Sometimes you do still get fussy.  You are so funny in that you don&#8217;t want a pacifier at all, sometimes you will suck your thumb but you would prefer my pinky to calm you down. I took a picture of this the other day just to document.  We love you so much William and can&#8217;t wait to see what new things you accomplish in the next month!

We had a busy Halloween weekend. Friday night Reeves went to Summerville for the night and Bobby and I went to a costume party.  We had so much fun!  We didn&#8217;t take a single picture though of us together.  We decided that we definitely need to get better about that. Saturday morning Bobby and I made our way to Summerville.  My sister Megan was in town for the weekend so we all went to lunch.  That afternoon our neighborhood had a block party.  We didn&#8217;t stay long there.  I think we were all pretty tired from Friday night.  We ended up going to dinner at a fairly new restaurant called Caliente with some friends, but then came home and relaxed.  Today was Halloween.  Reeves had a great time. He dressed up as Frankenstein.  I think he looked pretty cute!  He did a great job too, we lasted about an hour with him walking around the neighborhood.  He loved putting the candy in his candy bag.  His bag got pretty heavy towards the end of the night but wouldn&#8217;t let Bobby or I hold it for him.  We went with his neighborhood friends.  I love that we live in a neighborhood with some many children his age.  They all looked so cute walking around the neighborhood together.  Well that was our Halloween weekend.  I hope you all had a great weekend as well!
